Hi, I'm Rob. I've worked for 17 years in the EZ-pass and tolling field as a computer and electronics technician. I'm currently learning Python programming in order to grow into a new career. 
I'm looking forward to adding my projects to Github and collaborating with other programmers. Currently I'm most excited about working with spreadsheets and automating boring and repetitive 
tasks. I look forward to sharing some of my work with the community.
